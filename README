This is an experimental MUD client. I wanted to build something like Mudlet,
but base it on Pure python.

I have the components to execute the Python commands in an eval block. I need
to clean up the eval environment so that it will remember variables the user
created and provide some useful default functions.

I got stuck on the VT100 commands. At one point, I remember I had colors
working. Adapting the QTextBrowser to a VT100 terminal is not easy. There were
a couple of examples of people who actually did it, but it's not trivial.
Mudlet is based on Qt but as far as I can tell, they implemented the main
window on a QWidget, and took the time to write the draw functions by hand.

I tried to find a way to embed Konsole using a KPart, but there weren't a lot
of examples on the net.

At this point, I think what I will do is create a basic text-based mud client,
with commands that will create windows. That way, Konsole is the principle
environment, and you can spawn windows that do things like show you the
current room you are in, your inventory, or your map. Of course, then we have
a basic Unix environment, where the main program just spawns subprocesses that
it feeds data to.

This is a current project that I'm still excited about (2011-07), and I am
probably going to expand on this.
